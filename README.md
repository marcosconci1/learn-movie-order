We created a movie order page, focusing on the essentials of web page design and CSS styling. We reviewed project requirements, applied initial styling, and tackled fundamental HTML tags and design challenges. Along the way, we explored the CSS Box Model, addressed UI issues, and refined the design using background positioning and shorthand properties.
